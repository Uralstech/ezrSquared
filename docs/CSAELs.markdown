# C# in ezr²
{: .no_toc }

ezr² allows you to embed it to other programs and can also use C# variables and functions in ezr² code. **How can you take advantage of this?**

## Embedding ezr² to your application!
ezr² code is much simple and easier to understand than, for example, C# code. So, **embedding ezr² to your application
adds the ability to script events and/or high level game logic in the hand of your designers and end users**.

## ezr² doesn't have [feature-ezr²-doesn't-have] built-in!
Now, this is where **CSAELs** step in. CSAELs or **CSharp Assisted Ezr² Libraries** are, to state the obvious, libraries or modules written in C# for ezr² scripting.
With CSAELs, anyone who knows C# can add any feature they want to ezr²! These features can also be built-in to ezr² in the future - it's a win-win situation! All you have to do
is wrap C# variables, functions and whatnot in classes the ezr² interpreter can understand. All these "wrapper" classes will be detailed in this page.
