## Installation
**BEFORE YOU START CODING:** ezr is still in **pre-release** status. That means **ezr might get backwards-incompatible updates every now and then**.

Now, to install ezr on your PC, follow these steps:

### Windows
1. Download the latest release of ezr (`ezrSquared.Windows.Installer.exe`) from [***GitHub***](https://github.com/Uralstech/ezrSquared/releases).
2. Run the installer and go through the installation.
3. Add the folder where ezr has been installed (`C:\Users\[USER]\AppData\Local\Programs\ezr` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\ezr` by default) to your PATH environment variable.
4. Verify that ezr is installed by running `ezrSquared` in a terminal - the ezr biShell (built-in shell) should open (press Ctrl+C to exit).
5. Start coding!

### Ubuntu
1. Download the latest release of ezr (`ezrSquared.Ubuntu.tar.xz`) from [***GitHub***](https://github.com/Uralstech/ezrSquared/releases).
2. Extract the `tar.xz` file to a folder of your choice.
3. Add the folder to your PATH environment variable.
4. Verify that ezr is installed by running `ezrSquared` in a terminal - the ezr biShell (built-in shell) should open (press Ctrl+C to exit).
5. Start coding!

### Android
Check out [***ezr Portable Interpreter on Google Play***](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Uralstech.ezrSquaredPortableInterpreter), an interpreter made with the help of
[***ezr Net4.8***](https://github.com/Uralstech/ezrSquaredNet4.8) in [***Unity***](https://unity.com/)!

## Usage

An ezr script has the extension `.ezr2`. To run an ezr script, use the `ezrSquared` command followed by the path to the script file:

```cmd
> ezrSquared hello.ezr2
Use the "ezrSquared" command without any arguments to start the biShell:

> ezrSquared
You can type any valid ezr expression in the shell and see its result.
```

## Documentation
The official documentation for ezr is available in the [***Introduction and Documentation page***](https://uralstech.github.io/ezrSquared/Introduction), but is still **work in progress**.
While I finish that, check out some example programs in [***GitHub***](https://github.com/Uralstech/ezrSquared/tree/master/Tests).
