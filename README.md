# The `ezr²` Programming Language
**ezr², or ezrSquared when you can't use the `²` symbol (or it's too inconvenient) - is an easy to learn and practical interpreted programming language for beginners and experts alike made in C#!**

More information and documentation about ezr² is available at ***https://uralstech.github.io/ezrSquared***!

## What's the 'ezrSquared-re' branch?
ezrSquared is being rewritten from the ground up! Expect more features, better performance and better code documentation!

## Update!
I've finished the parser! Well, the important bits of it. Next what's left is (in no perticular order):
* QuickSyntax integration into the parser.
* Making the whole interpreter.
* Probably a lot more testing.
