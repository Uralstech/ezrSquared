## The name feels familiar...
ezr² is heavily inspired by [ezr](https://github.com/Uralstech/ezrlang), which is another one of my projects -
Here are the similarities:
* The syntax is quite similar
* The code is based on the same concept
* Well, the name is basically the same

And the differences:
* ezr was made in Python
* QSyntax is not available in ezr
* Count loops are different
* All the variable types have had an overhaul in ezr²
* ezr² is much faster
